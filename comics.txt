I don't like reading older comicbooks since they have so much damn exposition. What is the point of
having the art if you're jsut going to explain everything in the panel anyway 

The art itself is a whole other issue. I know comic artists were limited by the tools of their
time but looking at the grainy, incoherent mess of art around the 1930s and 1940; it's hard to look at times.
But there is a certain charm to it, seeing the prototype of what's to be, the origins of such great comics.
